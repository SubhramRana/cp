Euler Path / circuit
-----
0. OBSERVATIONsum of degree of all the vertices of an undirected graph is always even.
   REASON --> Each edge contributes both the connected vertices 1 in terms of degree. If there are 'e' number of edges, the sum of degree of all the
              vertices will be 2*'e' which is even. Due to this, you can furtehr conclude that, number of odd-degree vertices is even.(think why!)
